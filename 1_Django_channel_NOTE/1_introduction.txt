1) Django Channels :
    Channels allow Django projects to handle HTTP along with asynchronous protocols like WebSockets, MQTT, 
    chatbots, and more. Channels preserve the synchronous behavior of Django and add a layer of asynchronous 
    protocols allowing users to write the views that are entirely synchronous, asynchronous, or a mixture 
    of both. Channels basically allow the application to support “long-running connections”. It replaces 
    Django’s default WSGI with its ASGI.
